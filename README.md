**Please Note:** Changes made with AdvancedTrack are saved automatically. The save data is tied to the park name and **not** the park save file. Make sure to use a unique park name to prevent conflicts. AdvancedTrack save data does **not** transfer from user to user. This will be improved when the new save file format is released.

# Advanced Track
Advanced Track is a plugin that allows users to setup more advanced logic based track features.
Right now the plugin can primarily be used to create switch tracks.

You can select a location for a vehicle sensor, and the location of a switch track, the track at the switch track is re-ordered whenever a vehicle passes over the sensor (when the last car on a train leaves the sensor tile).

This can in turn be used to create complex systems like a functional dual loading stations, or alternating track routes.

## Installation
Copy the JS file in the `build` directory from this repository to `OpenRCT2/plugin`, you can access the tools via the map toolbar.
