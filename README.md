# Advanced Track
Advanced Track is a plugin that allows users to setup more advanced logic based track features.
Right now the plugin can primarily be used to create switch tracks.

You can select a location for a vehicle sensor, and the location of a switch track, the track at the switch track is re-ordered whenever a vehicle passes over the sensor (when the last car on a train leaves the sensor tile).

This can in turn be used to create complex systems like a functional dual loading stations, or alternating track routes.

## Installation
Download the latest `AdvancedTrack.js` file from the releases page:
https://github.com/oli414/AdvancedTrack/releases/
And place it in `OpenRCT2/plugin`, you can now access the tools via the map toolbar.
